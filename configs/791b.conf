  ! Weighted Least-Connections
  ! Distributes more requests to servers with fewer active connections relative to their capacities. Capacity is indicated by a user-assigned weight, which is then adjusted upward or downward by dynamic load information. The addition of weighting makes this algorithm ideal when the real server pool contains hardware of varying capacity.

  ! key to making this work:
  ! use IP address in same network segment for the virtual IP.
  ! would be nice to figure out how to make it work when the virtual IP is in a different segment
