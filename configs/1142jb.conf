    # However, at the same time, higher values do not work. Testing this out I found that using 256 and 255
    # for the primary and secondary, respectively, works quite well.
    # It also seems like priority has flipped, with lower priorities preferred.
    # Priority is thus set via: 255 + ansible_local.host_id|int
    # Thus, this works out to:
    #   xlb1: 254 + 1 = 255
    #   xlb2: 254 + 2 = 256
    # There should never be an xlb3 as this is excessive.
